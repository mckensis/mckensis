Hi, I'm Aidan.

In July 2022 I left hospitality in pursuit of a career which is more synced up to my interests.

My current goal is to land a role in Web Development.

At the moment I am working my way through The Odin Project's curriculum.

This page will document my journey towards my career goal.
